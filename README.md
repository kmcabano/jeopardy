Future ideas to be implemented after this version of the game is complete
  Create the Double Jeopardy round before final jeopardy - reinitialize board with new clues, double dollar amounts, and another daily double
  Eliminate multiple choice - find a way to process typed responses, maybe if a reponse contains a certain keyword or keywords it would be declared correct?
  Add a third player option
  Create a huge database of categories, and make the initialize function call a random selection of those 6 categories to the board, making each game unique
    Or alternately, database every recorded jeopardy game, allowing ANY game to be called either randomly or by air date! This would be a....daunting task.
    Will add a "new game" button
